<p>My journey into software engineering began with a unique experience at the Kentucky State Board of Elections, where I worked closely with a team of software engineers and got a firsthand look at the impact they made. Seeing their problem-solving skills in action&mdash;and realizing how much it felt like piecing together a complex puzzle&mdash;left me inspired and eager to dive into the field. Now, as a full stack developer, I'm passionate about tackling technical challenges head-on and finding creative solutions.</p>
<p>Through this blog, I hope to share my journey in tech: the highs, lows, and everything in between. I know how tough the job search can be, so I'm here to offer encouragement and practical advice to anyone navigating similar paths. Alongside tech, you'll also find me reading, rock climbing, gaming, or hanging out with my dog. Let's explore the world of software together, celebrate wins, and grow our skills!</p>
